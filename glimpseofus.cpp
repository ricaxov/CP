    She'd take the world off my shoulders
    If it was ever hard to move
    She'd turn the rain to a rainbow
    When I was living in the blue
    Why then, if she is so perfect
    Do I still wish that it was you?
    Perfect don't mean that it's working
    So what can I do? (Ooh)
    When you're out of sight
    In my mind
    'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes
    And that's where I find a glimpse of us
    And I try to fall for her touch
    But I'm thinking of the way it was
    Said I'm fine and said I moved on
    I'm only here passing time in her arms
    Hoping I'll find
    A glimpse of us
    Tell me he savors your glory
    Does he laugh the way I did?
    Is this a part of your story?
    One that I had never lived
    Maybe one day you'll feel lonely
    And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse
    Maybe you'll start slipping slowly
    And find me again
    When you're out of sight
    In my mind
    'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes
    And that's where I find a glimpse of us
    And I try to fall for her touch
    But I'm thinking of the way it was
    Said I'm fine and said I moved on
    I'm only here passing time in her arms
    Hoping I'll find
    A glimpse of us
    Ooh, ooh-ooh
    Ooh, ooh-ooh
    Ooh, ooh, ooh
    'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes
    And that's where I find a glimpse of us
    And I try to fall for her touch
    But I'm thinking of the way it was
    Said I'm fine and said I moved on
    I'm only here passing time in her arms
    Hoping I'll find
    A glimpse of us
